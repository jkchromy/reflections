HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY AND THE REPOSITORY?
WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT OFFERS?

-staging area allows for multiple files to be selected for an iterative work / commit cycle.
-it also helps separate the files currently being worked on from files that maybe don't need version control.

CHANGE?

-even if multiple thing in multiple files have been changed, the staging area can be used to break changes into smaller pieces, single or fewer files, before the commit.
