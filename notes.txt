feat: a new feature
fix: a bug fix
docs: changes to documentation
style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
refactor: refactoring production code
test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

git add (staging area or index) makes it easy to break up a "too large" code change into smaller logical commits. a quick bug fix can be snuck in the middle of a work session.

git
clone
commit
log
diff
checkout
master
init
status

get diff
get diff --staged
get diff commitId commitId
git branch
git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2...
git reset --hard <commit_before_failed_merge_or_other_tragedy>
git show commit #show difference between commit and it's parent

git branches allow the programmer to switch to a different branch if he feels like working on some other feature, without worrying about breaking things or even remembering what he was working on.

git push local_branch remote_name_or_url
