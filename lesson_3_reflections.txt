When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--To allow multiple people to work on the same project.
--To allow you to work from different computers without worrying about trying to keep track of which computer has the master copy, and duplicating it on each pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--Having your local code change randomly while you're working on it sounds frustrating.
--Automatic updating would prevent you from working on older commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--A branch is created inside a single repository.
--A clone is a copy of a repository.
--A fork is a clone created for you by GitHub of a repository on it's site.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

--Any work or merges you do with that branch will be as relevent as possible.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

--Emailing files that have changed back and forth without GitHub.
--GitHub forces every user to be responsible for their own changes, and allows every contributer instant access to changes.
--Everyone can see all bugs and other issues and work on them.
