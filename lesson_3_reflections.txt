When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--To allow multiple people to work on the same project.
--To allow you to work from different computers without worrying about trying to keep track of which computer has the master copy, and duplicating it on each pc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--Having your local code change randomly while you're working on it sounds frustrating.
--Automatic updating would prevent you from working on older commits.
